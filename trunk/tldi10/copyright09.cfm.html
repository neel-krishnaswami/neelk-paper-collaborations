<font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong> -- COMPLETING THE ACM COPYRIGHT TRANSFER 
AND RELEASE FOR CONFERENCE A/V RECORDING AND DISTRIBUTION</font>	 

<font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">
</font><p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">Thank you for
submitting a paper for publication by ACM. ACM's publications are read
throughout the world in print and digital formats. ACM must manage
requests for reprinting, republishing, redistributing, digitizing,
posting to servers, translating, anthologizing, and other actions. It
is the policy of ACM to own the copyright on its technical publications
to protect the interests of ACM, its authors and their employers, and
at the same time to facilitate the appropriate reuse of this material
by others. United States Copyright Law requires that the transfer of
copyright of each contribution from the author to ACM be confirmed.
(See ACM Copyright Policy <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy">§2.1</a>).  </font></p>

<font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"><strong>
<p>How to Complete the ACM Copyright Form (the "Form").</p>
<ul>
	<li>	Part I:  Authors must select Boxes A and/or B, and sign Part I.</li>
	<li>	Part II:  Authors must select box A and sign Part II.  Authors must also select Box B if they have auxiliary materials.</li>
	<li>	Part III:  To be signed if authors used third party materials.</li>
	<li>	Part IV:  Authors must sign Part IV.</li>
</ul>
</strong>

</font><p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"><strong>Please
return the Form with the manuscript to the editor at the address on the
Form. Additional details about each Part of the Form are provided below.</strong></font></p>

<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">ACM authors retain all
proprietary rights other than copyright including a set of “Retained
Rights” stated on the Form. (Also see the ACM Copyright Policy, <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Definitive">§2.4</a>, <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Retained">§2.5</a> and the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#PPermissions">Permissions Policy</a>, §3 for further details).</font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"><strong>Part I.A. – Assent to Assignment</strong></font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">If you are employed and
prepared your paper as part of your job, or as a “work-made-for-hire,”
the rights to your paper may initially rest with your employer. If so,
the Form should be signed by an authorized person. If you sign the
Form, ACM assumes that you have been authorized to do so by the owner.
The Form must be received by ACM before processing of the manuscript so
publication can be completed.</font></p>
<p></p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">For jointly authored
papers, an original signature is required from one (assumed senior)
author only. However, we recommend that all authors read and agree to
the terms of the Form and that this single author act as duly
authorized agent of the others.
</font><p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"> <strong>Part I.B. – Declaration for Government Work</strong></font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">Check only Box B of Part I
of the Form if all authors are Government employees, and the work was
created as part of their job exclusively for a Government agency. A
statement of “public domain” will appear on the work submitted (the
“Work”) as it is not copyrightable. If any co-authors are not
government employees, Box A of Part I must also be checked, and a
modified copyright statement regarding government use will appear in
the publication. </font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">In the case of a Work
created under a Government contract or grant, ACM recognizes that the
Government has royalty-free permission to reproduce all or portions of
the Work, and to authorize others to do so for official Government
purposes only, if the contract/grant so requires. Authors employed by a
civilian agency working under Government contract, i.e., national
laboratory employees, are required to check both Box A and Box B of
Part I.</font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"><strong>Part II – Permissions</strong></font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">ACM requires a signed
release (rather than a transfer of copyright) to make and distribute
audio/video recordings. Please select Box A relating to this release.</font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">ACM also requires a signed
release to serve auxiliary materials, i.e. additional files, including
software and executables, that are not submitted for review as an
integral part of the work but are supplied by the author as useful and
interesting resources for the reader (collectively, the “Auxiliary
Materials”). Please also select Box B if you are supplying Auxiliary
Materials.</font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"><strong>Part III – Third Party Material</strong></font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">If you have incorporated
any material owned by a third party in your Work or into your Auxiliary
Material, you must fill out Part III of the Form and attach proof of
permission to include this material.</font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2"><strong>Part IV – Liability Waiver </strong></font></p>
<p><font arial="" face="helvetica" size="2">Everyone must sign Part IV.</font></p>
