\section{Introduction}

The thesis of this paper is that functional reactive programming has not taken the 
categorical structure of causal functions seriously enough, and by doing so we win 
along many axes. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We get a much more flexible API than arrow-style FRP interfaces
  permit, while still ruling out the possibility of space/time leaks.

\item This interface still has a very rich equational theory, and a
  semantics in terms of causal functions (generalized to higher-order). 

\item Nevertheless, we can give an efficient imperative implementation of the 
  interface, which allows using well-known techniques for ``retained-mode''
  style interfaces (i.e., DOM/scenegraph) to graphics APIs.  

\item Furthermore, we can prove the correctness of this implementation, using
  Hoare logic and a logical relation between the implementation and the semantics. 
\end{enumerate}
