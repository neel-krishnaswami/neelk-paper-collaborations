Dear Neel -

Here are my comments on your revised draft.

It is a substantial improvement.  The use of judgements with three contexts,
the rearrangement of the beginning of Chapter 3, and more generally, the
sharpening of the vocabulary have all made it much more intelligible.

But there are still many errors, most of them minor, but enough that they
will make the thesis unnecessarily difficult to read.  Just the accidental
ambiguity about whether Delta contexts are limited to propositional sorts
cost me a couple of hours.

My detailed comments include earlier comments that you seem to have overlooked,
as well as many new items, especially in Sections 3.5 to 3.7.  Unfortunately,
in the brief time I've had, I didn't get further than before.  (But I'm hoping
that Jonathan has given you equally detailed critiques of Chapters 4 and
onward, and that mistakes in the proofs will not reflect mistakes in the
theorems.)

I think you should spend a few days correcting as many of these errors as you
can (without major rewriting), and then send the corrected version to your
entire committee.  There may, of course, be points you disagree with - do what
you think is best and then - after you finish the corrections and send them to
the committee - let me know about the disagreements.  (Incidentally, I'm not
(more than slightly) unhappy with your decision to stay with environments
that are nested pairs.)

When you can defend will depend on how fast the committee members can read the
thesis.  This will depend on the number of errors, but even without errors it
would not be light summer reading.  So I can't predict whether you will be able
to defend when you come over for MFPS.

All the best,

   John


page 7, line 9 from bottom - "kappa" should be "\kappa".  The expression
"\kappa\rightarrow\kappa" should be moved back to before "built".

page 11, next to last display.  The last equation here says that
[[Theta |- A:bigstar]] is a function from [[\Theta]] to normal forms.
The first equation on page 14 says that exactly the same entity is a function
from [[\Theta]] to a domain. To avoid confusing the reader hopelessly, you
must change one of these notations.  As I suggested before, I'd add a
superscript "s" (for set-theoretic semantics, or even "syntactic" semantics)
to all uses of emphatic brackets defined on page 11.

Also in the next to last display, shouldn't

   [[Theta |- A:bigstar]] in [[Theta]] -> [[bigstar]]

be added?

page 11, sentence before last display - theta(tau) should be theta.

page 28, Rule ETLam - This rule must be restricted to avoid an instance such
as

   alpha:*; x:alpha |- x:alpha
   ----------------------------------------------------
   x:alpha |- (Lambda alpha:*. x):forall alpha:*. alpha

You can either add the side condition that alpha does not occur free in any
type in Gamma, or add the premiss Theta |- Gamma.  This seems to be more than
the Barendregt convention.  Notice that the corresponding side condition occurs
in Rule TAbsAll in Figure 3.3 on page 82.

page 30, Figure 2.12 - At the beginning of this figure, you might state

   [[Theta;Gamma |- e:A]]^e theta in

     [[Theta |- Gamma]]theta -> [[Theta |- A:bigstar]]theta

(where the arrows denote domains of continuous functions).  Notice that I
have elided the occurrences of (K,K).

In the first equation, pi_i(gamma) isn't quite right, since gamma belongs
to an iterated binary product, not an n-ary product.  You should probably
write (and explain) (gamma)_Gamma, using the same kind of abbreviation as was
defined in the last display on page 11.

You should also define the notation iter_A[i,s].

Whenever v or tau is bound by a lambda, you should indicate the domain of the
function being described.

In the last line, Theta |- A == B:bigstar is a premiss of rule EKeq, not
a conclusion.  I suspect you mean all of the rules in Figure 2.5.

page 31, Figure 2.13 - At the beginning of this figure, you should state

   [[Theta;Gamma |- c div A]]^e theta in

     [[Theta |- Gamma]]theta -> (([[Theta |- A:bigstar]]theta -> K) -> K)

I presume that [[A]]theta abbreviates

   [[Theta |- A:bigstar]]theta

(with (K,K) elided).  If you use this abbreviation, you should remark on it,
making it clear that Theta is implicit.

In the first equation, should the subscript on eta be [[A]] instead of
[[A]]theta?

In the second equation, you should rename c to avoid the collision of
metavariables.

page 31 - In each of the bullet points below the figure, "theta,[theta(tau)]"
should be "[theta,theta(tau)]".  Also, why use bullet points here when you
enumerate the two cases in the next two lemmas.

page 31, Lemma 10 - There are missing occurrences of Gamma' in the third and
fifth lines.

It would improve readabilty if the statement of Lemma 10 were as similar as
possible to that of Lemma 9.  Is there a reason why the extra pair in the
kinding contexts in Lemma 9 can appear only at the end, while the extra pair
in the typing contexts in Lemma 10 can occur anywhere in the context?

Also, in the last line of Lemma 10, "c:B" should be "c div B".

page 32, Figure 2.14 - In the conclusion of rule EqSumEta, inr x should be
inr y.

pp. 34-54 - It would be helpful to include the numbers of the lemmas.  Is
there a reason why the proofs are in a different order than the statements
of the lemmas in the previous section?

page 42, case EqPairSnd - In line 1 the last occurrence of e_1 should be e_2.
In line 4 EFst should be ESnd.

page 43, case EqFunEta - Something is wrong, since you want to conclude
that e and e' have type A -> B.

page 62, first displayed equation - Since * is a kind, it shouldn't be used
here.  It would be better to write () or (cdot).

page 67, third line of 3.3.2 - p should be P and q should be Q.

page 67, displayed equation - It would be wise to parenthesize Best(Q),
so that one doesn't read this as (C Best)(Q)h.

page 79, line numbered 10 - In order for line 11 to hold, line 10 must
give s*p preceq r*p.

page 79, lines 4-5 of Section 3.5 - All occurrences of "sort" should be
"sorts".  Also, "v => omega" should be "omega => v".

page 80, line 3 - This looks like the minus sign is a logical connective.
You should at least change it to a long dash, or better, replace both dashes
by commas.

page 80, line 15 from bottom - This appears to say that any sort can appear
in a propositional context, but the grammar in Figure 3.1 says that only
propositional sorts can appear in a propositional context.  This is very
confusing.  I'm assuming that the grammar is right.

page 80, line 11 from bottom - The judgement Theta rhd Delta is not defined in
Figure 3.2.

page 81, Figure 3.2 - This is the first time that I've noticed that
well-formedness rules allow formations that are forbidden by the syntax.
According to the rules, prop => A is a sort.  You really need two kinds of
judgements - for sorts and for propositional sorts.

page 82, Figure 3.3 - Why does Theta |- Gamma occur as a premiss in TType
but not in THyp?

Unless I've overlooked some, you have seven different varieties of lambda
expressions, described by the rules KLam, ELam, ETLam, TAbs1, TAbs2, TAbs3, and
TAbsAll, without explaining much rationale about the notation (which confused
me).

I think the lambda expressions in TAbs3 are abbreviations for those in TAbsAll
where alpha does not occur free in v.  If so, you might remark on this.  You
might even eliminate TAbs3.

page 83, line 7 - It is confusing to use top and bot both as domain elements
and as truth values, particularly when top and bot in the Sierpinski space
carry the connotation of false and true respectively.  Why have (typically
boldface) true and false gone out of style?

page 83, line 3 from bottom - Is a "programmatic subexpression" just a
"program subexpression"?   What is a "ghost expression"?  It doesn't seem
anything like a ghost variable.

page 85, line 3 of the display - (K,K) has been elided here.  Unless I missed
it, I don't think you've ever explained this useful elision, which happens
fairly often.

page 85, line 5 of the display - The last occurrence of omega should be v.

page 85, line 9 of the display - The last occurrence of theta should be
outside the emphatic brackets.

page 85, Section 3.6 - The beginning of this section doesn't mesh well with the
actual presentation, which is

   (1) Interpretation of sorts and contexts by sets

   (2) An intertwined interpretation of terms and specifications

   (3) Lemmas about substitution

I don't see anything in Section 3.6 that shows that the equality judgement for
sorts is sound. (This seems to occur at tne end of Section 3.7.)   The remark
about "a pair of indexed, recursive definitions" seems to refer to Figure 3.6
and 3.7 rather than 3.5, i.e., (2) above rather than (1).  Also, what does
"indexed" refer to?

page 85, line 3 from bottom - Should "well-sorting" be "well-sorted"?

page 86, line 4 - "extendeding" should be "extending".

page 86, Section 3.6.3 - For lack of time, I'm skipping these three lemmas.

page 87, Figure 3.6 - (My line numbers here are taken by counting the lines
that start at the left margin.)

   lines 5, 6, and 7 - theta should occur after the first emphatic right
   bracket.

   line 8 - the three occurences of delta should each be "theta gamma delta"
   (if line 1 is to be believed).

   line 11 - See my comment about pi_i(gamma) on page 30.

   last line - "lambda loc. v when loc = l" should be "lambda loc in {l}. v".

page 88, Figure 3.7 - Shouldn't S \otimes r occur in this figure (and in
Figure 3.4)?

page 90, Figure 3.8 - In AxFix, q(a) should be q.  

page 91, Figure 3.9 - In AxEquality, shouldn't c[e/x] be [e/x]c, and
similarly for c[e'x]?

page 92, Figure 3.10 - What are the "axioms of higher-order separation logic"?

page 93, first item in last enumeration - "Delta|-" should be
"Theta;Gamma;Delta\rhd".

page 93, second item in last enumeration - the last occurrence of delta should
be "theta gamma delta".

page 93, third item in last enumeration - the last two occurrences of "delta|-"
should be "theta gamma delta\rhd".  If this is meant to hold for terms of all
sorts, you should drop the word "assertion" and replace the occurrences of
"prop" by omega.

You might subscript the two occurrences of top in the second list to remind
the reader that they have different meanings.  More generally, there are so
many different domains running around in this thesis that top and bot should
frequently be subscripted, just to remind the reader which domain he is
currently living in.

page 95, line 17 - "idealized" should be "Idealized".

page 95, line 5 before bottom - "it" should be "It".

page 95, line 3 before bottom  - "become true specifications" doesn't
make sense.
