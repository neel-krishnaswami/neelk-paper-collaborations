\begin{dedication}
I would like to thank my wife, Rachel, for her love, patience, and
understanding.

My parents encouraged me to study computers.

I am not at all sure this was what they had in mind.

%% Obviously, it's probably a good idea to break the various sections of your thesis
%% into different files and input them into this file...

\begin{abstract}
In this thesis I show is that it is possible to give modular
correctness proofs of interesting higher-order imperative programs
using higher-order separation logic.
\end{abstract}

\begin{acknowledgments}
I would like to begin by thanking my advisors for giving me perhaps
more rope than was advisable. John and Jonathan were both very
tolerant of my sudden enthusiasms, my half-baked ideas, and general
tendency to wander off in peculiar directions. 

Lars was an invaluable source of support and advice, and after every
trip to Denmark I returned significantly more knowledgeable than
before I left. I would like to thank Bob for an act he may not even
recall any more: as a new graduate student, he informed me that I
would be coming to ConCert group meetings, despite technically not
even being part of the ConCert project.
 
As a consequence, I have the need and the pleasure to thank the
whiteboard gang for their willingness to talk. Noam Zeilberger and
Jason Reed were particularly inspiring examples of people following
their mathematical muse, and William Lovas, Daniel Licata, Kevin
Watkins, Joshua Dunfield, Carsten Varming, and Rob Simmons were
reliable sources of type-theoretic and semantic inspiration.

Whenever I needed a different perpsective, the Plaid group was
there. I'd like to thank Donna Malayeri, Kevin Bierhof, and Nels
Beckman in particular....
% Ruy Ley-Wild

% Aleks Nanevski Nick Benton 

Hongseok Yang, Peter O'Hearn, Philippa Gardner, and Matthew Parkinson
were all encouraging above and beyond the call of duty to a random
student from thousands of miles away.

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages, 
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
