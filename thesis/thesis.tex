\begin{abstract}
In this thesis I show is that it is possible to give modular
correctness proofs of interesting higher-order imperative programs
using higher-order separation logic.

I would like to thank my advisors for giving me perhaps more rope than
was advisable. 

My parents encouraged me to study computers. I am not sure this was 
what they had in mind.

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages, 
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
